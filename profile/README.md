# 🚀 Welcome to KAP Theorem! 🚀

> "Friendship is like programming: it works based on mutual trust, requires constant communication, and crashes without proper exception handling." 

## 👨‍💻 Who We Are

We're three close friends who debugged our way through undergraduate studies at PES University (Class of 2022) and are now executing distributed systems across different US universities for our Masters programs.

### The Stack:

* **[@kushalkrishnappa](https://github.com/kushalkrishnappa)** - *K for Kushal* - *Runtime Environment: Northeastern University* 🐾
  * "While (studying) { coffee++; sleep--; }"

* **[@abhira0](https://github.com/abhira0)** - *A for Abhishek* - *Runtime Environment: North Carolina State University* 🐺
  * "Git commit -m 'Pushing boundaries and breaking production at NCSU'"
  * Want to know more? Head over to [abhirao.in](https://abhirao.in/)

* **[@Pulasthya](https://github.com/Pulasthya)** - *P for Pulasthya* - *Runtime Environment: SUNY Buffalo* 🐃
  * "function getLocation() { return 'Where the snow never stops'; }"

## 🔄 The KAP Theorem Advantage

> Unlike the traditional CAP Theorem where you can only have 2 out of 3 properties, our KAP Theorem guarantees all three work together with zero tradeoffs!

From building projects in the sunny campus of PES University to branching out to different corners of the US for graduate studies, we've maintained our stable connection with minimal latency. Our friendship has survived more merge conflicts than our code repositories!

**K**ushal + **A**bhishek + **P**ulasthya = A distributed system that achieves the impossible: Consistency, Availability, AND Partition Tolerance. Take that, Eric Brewer!

## 💾 Legacy Projects

Our undergraduate years at PES University (2018-2022) were filled with:
- Pulling all-nighters to fix bugs that turned out to be missing semicolons
- Creating "groundbreaking" projects that were just fancy CRUD applications
- Debating tabs vs. spaces while consuming concerning amounts of caffeine

## 🚧 Current Development Environment

Despite being distributed across different servers (universities), we're still committing to the same repository of friendship. Our timezone differences have only taught us the true meaning of asynchronous communication!

## 📣 Famous Last Words

> "It worked on my machine." - Every one of us at some point

> "Let's meet at 2 AM because that's the only time all our timezones align." - Our calendar invites

> "We should document this." - Things we say but never do

> "Unlike CAP theorem, our friendship never makes you choose just two." - KAP theorem whitepaper, 2022

## 🔮 Future Deployments

After our Masters degree hotfixes, we plan to merge back to the main branch with enhanced features and backward compatibility with our roots.
